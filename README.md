# js_password_generator
This is the repository for my Javascript Password Generator Project

**Overview**

In Businesses today, especially transactions occuring in physical locations, it is imperative for employees to safeguard their work from unforseen cyber attacks. The minimal requirement is for every staff to log on to the Company's local network with a secret password at every sign on. Even with the use of these secret passwords, some employees fall prey to attacks by compromising their passwords carelessly.

The motivation behind this project is to help users create a unique, secure, random password at every sign on to ward off attacks. It is secure because a new combination of passwords are generated at each click of the button, so even if an attacker had memorised my password by looking over my sign on today, that password will be useless to the hacker tomorrow.

In executing this project, I defined certain specifications including a combination of both upper and lower case letters, a minimum acceptable character length and special characters.

**Installation**

Acombination of HTML,CSS and Javascript codes were deployed for the installation of this project.
